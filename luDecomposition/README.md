# Lu Decomposition
## Input
  ### The input for the algorithim is a square matrix.  
## Output
### The Algorithim yields P, which is an identity matrix, L, which is the lower matrix, and U, which is the upper matrix.   
## Limitations 
  ### The code fails to properly display the identity matrix with larger matrices. 
## Info about the code 
  ### The code is the start of a method of finding the roots of a problem. In the future I plan to expand the code to do just that.
