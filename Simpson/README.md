# Simpson 
## Input
  ### The input for the algorithim is an array of tabulated data.  
## Output
### The Algorithim yields the area of the tabulated data  
## Limitations 
  ### The method my code uses to find the distance between the array's in suseptible to a computer rounding error should the inputed numbers be too small.
## Info about the code 
  ### The code uses a hybrid of 1/3 rule and trapezoidal rule to solve area. Ideally I'd want to use the 3/8 method as it is more accurate for lengthy tabulated data.
