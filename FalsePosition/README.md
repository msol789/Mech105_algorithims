# FalsePosition 
## Inputs
  ### The inputs for the algorithim are A function, An upper limit, lower limit, a maxiter(max iterations), and es(desired relative error)
## Outputs 
  ### The Algorithim yields the root for the function, the function itself, the amount of iterations it took to run, and the error  
## Limitations 
  ### My code right now fails to show the proper iterations and estimated error. This intern impacts how to code runs.
## Info about the code 
  ### The False Position code seeks to find roots through continuous evaluations of slopes at certain points.
